By default, all users created are assigned guest roles that can only create rooms, fetch room-types and perform all other activities **EXCEPT** creating, editing and deleting room-types which only the admin can do.\n2. To login as an admin, you need to use the following credentials: \"email\": adminchinyere98@gmail.com, \"password\": adminchi98234.\n3. Before performing any operation apart from creating and login users, you need to authenticate. To do this, you need to get the token from login and put it in the bearer as shown below in the endpoints.\n4. Please note that you can only update, read and delete the current user logged in based on the token. **YOU CAN NOT SEE ALL USERS ONLY THE LOGGED IN USER.**",
